# Flights and Public Holidays Dashboard  

This project explores how flight ticket prices and traveler volumes in the United States shift around major public holidays.  
The goal was to see whether flights cost more during holidays and how demand changes before, during, and after those dates.  

I built this dashboard in **Power BI** to make the analysis interactive.  
Users can explore ticket prices by airline, booking agency, and destination state.  
The dashboard also includes a U.S. map showing traveler volume by state and a calendar heatmap highlighting price changes on specific days.
