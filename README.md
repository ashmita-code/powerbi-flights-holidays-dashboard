# Flights and Public Holidays Dashboard  

This project explores how flight ticket prices and traveler volumes in the United States shift around major public holidays before covid.  
The goal was to see whether flights cost more during holidays and how demand changes before, during, and after those dates.  

I built this dashboard in **Power BI** to make the analysis interactive.  
Users can explore ticket prices by airline, booking agency, and destination state.  
The dashboard also includes a U.S. map showing traveler volume by state and a calendar heatmap highlighting price changes on specific days.

## What youâ€™ll find in this project  
- Comparison of average ticket prices **before, during, and after holidays**  
- Ticket price breakdown by **airline** (United, American Airlines, Alaska, Southwest, etc.) and **booking agencies**  
- **Traveler volume per state**, visualized on a U.S. map  
- **Calendar heatmap** showing daily ticket price fluctuations (e.g., around Memorial Day)

## Key takeaways from the analysis  
- Flight prices are generally **highest on holidays** and drop **right after** the holiday period.  
- Certain states, like **Delaware** and **Connecticut**, consistently show higher average fares.  
- Traveler volume spikes around popular holidays such as **Memorial Day** and **Thanksgiving**.
